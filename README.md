## Management AWS CLI - Profiles

Let's imagine you have a few AWS customer accounts to manage. In this scenario, the AWS CLI tool can help you with this purpose.

In order to facilitate this access to multiple AWS accounts via CLI, AWS itself allows you to configure profiles for access. With profiles configured, your credentials are already linked to these profiles.

You can also access another AWS account, just change the profile that is currently being used.
Access will be governed by the permissions that will be assigned to these profiles in each of these AWS accounts.

This my first project to support some admin to manage your
AWS account by using script shell.
